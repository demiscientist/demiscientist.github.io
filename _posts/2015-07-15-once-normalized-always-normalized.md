Quantum mechanics’ approach to solve a problem involves looking for the particle’s (the body under consideration) wave function, $$\Psi(x,t)$$, and we get it by solving the Schrödinger equation: 
\begin{equation}
i\hbar\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2} + V\Psi}
\end{equation}
